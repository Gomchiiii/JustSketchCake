# JUSTSKETCHCAKE

JUSTSKETCHCAKE is a collaborative project developed by a two-person team. This program aims to assist users in easily creating order forms for custom cakes and visualizing the expected appearance of the cake.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Just Sketch Cake
- **Project Description**: A program that helps users easily draw order forms for custom-made cakes and shows the expected shape of the cake.

## Key Features

1. Interactive cake design interface
2. Cylindrical mapping for 3D cake visualization
3. Custom icing stroke implementation
4. Rotating animation for cake sides
5. Decorative elements placement
6. Color selection and manipulation

## Technical Highlights

- Custom `JSCIcingStroke` class for realistic icing effects
- Cylindrical mapping function for 3D representation of 2D images
- Affine transform usage for upper cake surface rotation
- Utility class (`JSCUtil`) for commonly used image processing functions
- Implementation of various command classes for different cake design actions

## Project Structure

The project follows a scene-scenario structure and includes several key classes:

- `JSCXform`: Handles transformations
- `JSCCakeSideMgr` and `JSCCakeUpperMgr`: Manage side and upper surfaces of the cake
- `JSCIcingPtCurve`: Custom data structure for saving icing input points
- `JSCDecoStamp`: Handles decorative elements

## Recent Updates

- Implementation of cylindrical rotating animation
- Completion of inverse cylindrical mapping
- Development of custom icing strokes
- Integration of upper and side rotating animations

## Team Members

This project is a collaborative effort by a two-person team. Both team members have contributed significantly to the design, implementation, and ongoing development of JUSTSKETCHCAKE.
